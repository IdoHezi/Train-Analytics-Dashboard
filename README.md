## 💡 Business Insights
From the dashboards, several key insights were observed:
1. **Delays Analysis**  
   - Signal failures (22.7%) and technical issues (20.1%) are the main causes of delays.  
   - Weather conditions contribute significantly (~15%).
   - Average delay of 3.24 minutes is relatively low, but 4.1K affected rides represent significant customer impact 

2. **Rides Trends**  
   - Average weekly rides are stable (~1,100–1,200 rides), but delays fluctuate around 200–300 per week.  
  - Number of routes is stable
3. **Revenue & Ticket Sales**  
   - Strong revenue performance (724K) with healthy transaction volume (30.8K)
   - Off-Peak and Anytime tickets are less popular, signaling opportunity for targeted promotions.  
   - Low refund rate (3.53%) suggests acceptable service quality but room for improvement.
   - Credit card dominance in payments.



4. **Actionable Recommendations**  
   - Priority investment in **signal infrastructure upgrades** to reduce the top cause of delays.  
   - Consider **seasonal staffing adjustments** to handle peak weather-related disruptions.
   - Revenue Protection: Focus on delay reduction to further minimize refunds and improve customer satisfaction
   - Promote **Off-Peak and Anytime tickets** to balance demand and maximize revenue.
